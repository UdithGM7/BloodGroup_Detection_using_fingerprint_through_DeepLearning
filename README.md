# Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Detection 

## Overview
  **This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict blood group types using fingerprint patterns. 
  **The model analyzes unique fingerprint features to provide a non-invasive and efficient blood group identification method.

## Dataset
